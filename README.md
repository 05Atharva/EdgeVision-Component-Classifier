# EdgeVision – Electronic Component Classifier

A lightweight **computer vision + TinyML-ready** image classification project for
distinguishing **Capacitors** and **Inductors** using transfer learning.

This repository currently focuses on **model training, evaluation, and image-based inference**.
Embedded deployment and automation are planned as future work.
