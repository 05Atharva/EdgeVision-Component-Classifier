## Future Scope

- Convert trained model to TensorFlow Lite for ESP32
- Deploy inference on ESP32-CAM
- Integrate with conveyor belt system for automated segregation
- Real-time component detection and sorting
- Add multi-class classification (Resistors, Diodes, ICs)

⚠️ Note: Hardware integration is planned and not part of the current implementation.
